## Leveraging Earth Observation Data for Informed Agricultural Decision-Making

**For now, we have agreed to the following structure:**
    - A home page
    - A dashboard page
    - A help page

**Home page:**
    - About the project
    - Problems faced by the industry
    - Our solution

**Dashboard:**
    - This is the place to create and submit queries
    - Results of the queries will be displayed here

**Help:**
    - Will offer some sort of documentation or an FAQ section to help the user navigate

**API explored so far**
    - We have started with ClimateSERV, you can access the documentation here: [ClimateSERV](https://readthedocs.org/projects/climateserv/downloads/pdf/latest/)
    - To access the ClimateSERV API use:
        > conda install -c servir climateserv
        > pip install climateserv

**ClimateSERV Data Sources:**
    - Names for the data sources are complicated for both the developers and the end users. I have tried to translate them into easy-to-read terms. Please find the table attached:
